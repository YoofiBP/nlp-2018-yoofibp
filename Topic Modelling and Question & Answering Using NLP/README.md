# Topic Modelling and Question Answering using NLP
For this project we developed a Topic Modelling and Question Answering system using Natural Language Processing. Given a question, our  program is able to print the topic associated with the question.  For instance, given a statement such as “Who is the president of Ghana?” or  “Who is Ghana’s head of state?” the program should and would give the topic to be "Ghana Government". Given a question our program is able to return an answer to the question. Given a question such as “Who is the president of Ghana?” or  “Who is Ghana’s head of state?” the program should answer "Nana Akufo-Addo" in both cases


## Topic Modelling

* Latent Dirichlet allocation 

## Question and Answering
For Question and Answering, Implementations used are:
* Cosine Similarity and QR Pairs 
* Information Retreival Approach
