Sentiment Classification using Naive Bayes Classifier 
For this mini project I built a sentiment classifier from scratch using python to determine if a review is positive or negative based on the words used.

This is very useful in a scenario where an organisation would like to determine whether, across numerous reviews, they are thought of in a good way or not. 

### Requirements
python3 installed

### How to run
```
python3 yoofi_naive_bayes_final.py
